# SmartSets

SmartSets is a simple AI study tool that I created in my free time while I was completing my degree in computer science. I took a minor in psychology and found studying for the memorization-heavy tests tedious. 
Normal study apps like Quizlet were too impersonal, they would give you a set of flashcards and just ask you each one in a random order... and then when you're done... guess what... do it again. This process is inefficient
as you spend just as much time on the concepts you already know, as the ones you're struggling with. I thought there had to be a way to learn which concepts I have the most difficulty with, and then generate study sessions for myself where I'm forced to spend more time on my worst concepts. So that is exactly what I have done with SmartSets. 

Using natural language processing and a neural network to compare your answers to questions with the correct answer, smart sets is able to generate a numerical score to represent your competence in every question you answer. Then, using the Smart Shuffler, it creates unique study sessions that are different every time and correlate directly to your competence with each flashcard, forcing you to study your worst questions far more than those you know well. In my testing, I found using smartsets reduces the time it took me to fully memorize a set of questions by about ONE THIRD! 

I have used this app personally to study for my psychology exams, and it is a perfect example of how software does not need to be excessively complicated to solve everyday problems.
